## Notes
I faced a problem with mapping over the get response I got from axios get request

I spent most of my time trying to fix this bug, but because time was so tight I couldn't (I will continue working on it)
For now I copy the response and save it in an array object, and I map over it which works(the same process was done for get )

The second release will contain the rest of the feature as search engine, disabling buttons, updating request when scroll down reach bottom of page, and some animations
