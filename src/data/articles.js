          "lead_paragraph": "A commuter in Chicago read about the arrest of Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich. (Photo: Joshua Lott for The New York Times)In political circles and on op-ed pages, among top politicians and ordinary citizens, a single question seemed to dominate the conversation across Illinois on Wednesday: what to make of Governor Rod R. Blagojevich and the explosive, expletive-laden criminal complaint against him?  Mr. Blagojevich may be innocent until proven guilty, but the response to the accusations that he sought to auction off, among other things, the senate seat being vacated by Barack Obama was swift, harsh and widespread. It is time, many seemed to be saying, for the governor to go.  \"Blagojevich should pursue his presumed innocence as a private citizen, not as sitting governor of Illinois,\" read an editorial in the State Journal-Register, which blared the headline \"State of Shame\" on its front page. \"The Illinois General Assembly must convene immediately to remove Blagojevich from office by impeachment. We emphasize 'immediately.'\"   Illinois has seen its share of politicians who have traveled the path from the statehouse to the jailhouse, a pantheon that includes Mr. Blagojevich's disgraced predecessor, George H. Ryan, currently in federal prison. But even with that history — and the years of criticism, accusations, and rumors of federal investigations that followed Mr. Blagojevich — there was still a sense of amazement at the brazenness and spitefulness portrayed in the federal affidavit released on Tuesday.  \"I don't think anybody was surprised that he eventually got caught,\" James Edgar, a former Illinois governor who served from 1991 to 1999, said in an interview on Wednesday. \"People who followed government here knew that this governor was eventually going to get indicted on something. But I think we were all shocked with what he had tried this time. It was far worse than anybody could've imagined.\"    What has been particularly disappointing, Mr. Edgar said, is that Chicago had been reveling in pride after sending Mr. Obama to the White House, and in many ways the city was trying to revamp its image as a cesspool of corruption. The feeling that permeated the air in Grant Park on election night, where hundreds of thousands of people gathered to celebrate Mr. Obama's historic victory — which touched off celebrations across the globe — has, for now at least, evaporated.  \"There's no doubt that Chicago has had some problems,\" Mr. Edgar said. \"But it was working its way out of that, and its unfortunate that people around the country are talking about this again.\"  In the past 24 hours, as excerpts of Mr. Blagojavich's alleged statements have sunk in — \"I've got this thing, and it's [expletive] golden\" — few people, even fellow Democrats, have seemed willing to withhold judgment and stand by him. His second in command, Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn, who steadfastly defended Mr. Blagojevich when the two ran for re-election in 2006, immediately called for his ouster on Tuesday. Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and the Senate's second-ranking Democratic leader, suggested the governor could not be trusted and said he should be stripped of his power to appoint Mr. Obama's successor.  \"This is perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of Illinois government, and a stain that will not be easily removed,\" Dan Hynes, a Democrat and State Comptroller, said in a statement. \"Our government's ability to deal on a daily basis with the fiscal and economic crises we currently face demands leadership and integrity. Our governor cannot provide either.\"  But if the news was shocking and sobering to the governor's colleagues, it was met with a measure of relief and enthusiasm among his opponents.  \"I'm thinking, holy cow, Christmas came early,\" said Scott McCoy, the mayor of Pontiac, a central Illinois town that has fought Mr. Blagojevich's plans to shutter a local prison.   \"What first comes to mind is, it's about time,\" was how another critic, Steven Poe, 54, explained his reaction to the Associated Press. Mr. Poe is a resident of Springfield, a city that harbors some resentment against Mr. Blagojevich for his decision to relocate the state's Traffic Safety Division, which employed about 140 people, to southern Illinois.   Some relished the accusations, but with slight reservations. Rich Whitney, a founder of the Illinois Green Party who sought to unseat Mr. Blagojevich in 2006, said in an interview that the warm sense of schadenfreude that initially delighted him was eventually tempered by a dose of disappointment — if only because it meant a lost opportunity.  \"I was looking forward to running against him,\" said Mr. Whitney, a civil rights lawyer. \"With this cloud over him, I think he would've been a better opponent to challenge. But, oh well.\" ",
